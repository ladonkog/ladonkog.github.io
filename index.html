            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Giorgio Ladonko is a senior Aerospace Engineering student at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, pursuing his master’s degree in Aerospace Engineering through an accelerated program with a focus on Dynamics and Control. 
                As the project leader of a NASA-funded initiative, he has developed expertise in in-space manufacturing using coaxial continuous fiber 3D printing to optimize carbon fiber-reinforced materials for energy storage devices in microgravity environments. 
                Giorgio’s skills in refining materials, manufacturing techniques, and propulsion systems are complemented by his experience in aircraft stability, control dynamics, and hybrid-electric propulsion systems. 
                His work spans both aircraft and spacecraft engineering, with a passion for applying his knowledge to propulsion, dynamics, and control systems in challenging aerospace environments.
