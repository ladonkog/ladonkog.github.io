<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In my aircraft stability and controls class, I served as the assistant project leader for a semester-long project focused on a comprehensive stability analysis of the Beechcraft Model 18. This project required us to conduct an in-depth stability assessment, covering longitudinal, directional, and lateral stability. Through detailed hand calculations, we derived essential stability coefficients, further enhanced by meticulous research to obtain all relevant technical data for a reliable stability analysis.</p>

<p>In my role, I collaborated with the project leader to guide our team, ensuring that each member completed their calculations independently while promoting a supportive and collaborative environment. At the end of the semester, we consolidated our findings into a final report that detailed our methodologies and findings, maintaining consistency across individual results within a small margin of error. Our report also allowed us to analyze our approach, compare outcomes, and provide justifications for any discrepancies, demonstrating a thorough understanding of stability concepts.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Research and acquire comprehensive data required to analyze the stability of the Beechcraft Model 18.</li>
    <li>Perform detailed stability calculations to derive all stability coefficients for longitudinal, directional, and lateral stability.</li>
    <li>Calculate an optimal center of gravity position to achieve approximately 10% longitudinal stability.</li>
    <li>Develop an Excel model to iterate center of gravity values, ensuring 10% longitudinal stability and validating hand calculations.</li>
    <li>Document methodologies, results, and analyses in a comprehensive final report to showcase team understanding and analytical rigor.</li>
</ul>
<p>This project gave me valuable experience aligning academic and industry approaches to stability analysis, reinforcing skills in both individual calculation work and collaborative analysis.</p>
