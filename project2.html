            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <img src="SkySpecter.png" alt="Hybrid-Electric Aircraft Design" style="width:100%; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 15px;">
            <p>This project involved a collaboration with Verdego Aero, a leader in hybrid-electric power systems for aircraft. Our team was tasked with designing a hybrid-electric military logistics aircraft capable of meeting specific operational and performance criteria set forth by Verdego Aero. These requirements included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Accommodating a crew of two.</li>
                <li>Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL) capability in under 500 feet.</li>
                <li>A payload capacity of 2,000 lbs (excluding crew).</li>
                <li>A cruise speed of 175 knots.</li>
                <li>Battery-only flight for certain phases, including a 20 nm cruise, ascent, descent, and short takeoff/landing.</li>
                <li>A total range of 650 nautical miles.</li>
                <li>Use of at least one Verdego Aero generator to support hybrid-electric propulsion.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition to these design goals, the team established several enhancements to further improve the aircraftâ€™s capabilities, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The integration of Distributed Electric Propulsion (DEP) for improved efficiency.</li>
                <li>Enhanced maneuverability compared to traditional cargo and utility aircraft.</li>
                <li>The use of batteries for all takeoffs, ascents, descents, and landings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our team focused on optimizing the design for both aerodynamics and propulsion, ensuring that the aircraft met all of the operational goals while adhering to sustainable aviation practices.</p>
            
            <h2>Key Contributions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Performed initial tail sizing and geometry, optimizing aerodynamic efficiency and stability.</li>
                <li>Selected hybrid-electric propulsion components and optimized battery packs to meet energy requirements.</li>
                <li>Conducted stick-fixed stability analysis to evaluate aircraft control and performance.</li>
            </ul>
